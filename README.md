This is a randomized password generator, which can make a password that includes lower and upper case letters, numbers, and symbols. 

Per Jung's advice during Thursday's session, I referenced this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duNmhKgtcsI. My original pushes were based around this style of approaching the problem. However, I never could get the code to function properly. After a session with my tutor and discussing other methods with the study group, I gave up on that strategy and came at it from a different approach.
